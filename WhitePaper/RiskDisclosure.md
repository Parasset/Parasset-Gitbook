# Risk Disclosure

---

You need to understand the following risks and ensure that you participate in the parasset protocol in the right way when you enter the parasset contract and become a user/contract of the insurance fund LP (those who do not understand or cannot accept the risks are not recommended to participate):

1. Insurance funds may be at a loss in extreme situations, for example, asset prices fluctuate and lead to wear wearhouse storm, and insurance funds are responsible for compensation. Therefore, insurance funds are not a risk-free investment.

2. The rate of return of the insurance fund is uncertain: given a stable fee return, the more people participate in insurance, the lower the rate of return of the insurance fund; and the insurance premium depends on the asset size and the rate, which is also uncertain , So you canâ€™t treat insurance funds as a fixed-income investment.

3. The insurance fund invests in the underlying assets, but at the time of redemption, if the underlying assets in the insurance pool are insufficient, the underlying assets will be replaced by parallel assets. Therefore, there are situations in which only parallel assets can be obtained in the end when the underlying assets are invested. The insurance fund LP needs to be very clear about this risk.

4. Redemption time limit: The insurance fund cannot be redeemed immediately after the investment. It needs to be redeemed according to the agreed redemption time. The insurance fund LP needs to specifically clarify this restriction.
    

You need to understand the following risks and ensure that you participate in the parasset protocol in the right way when you enter the parasset protocol to become a minter (those who do not understand or cannot accept the risks are not recommended to participate):

1. Liquidation risk: When the asset price reaches the liquidation line, anyone can liquidate the debt position, causing the minter to lose a certain amount of residual value of the asset (the excess of the underlying asset generated).

2. Stability fee fluctuation risk: The stability fee is calculated based on the collateral rate and the system basic rate. Therefore, changes in the collateral rate or the system basic rate will bring fluctuations in the stability fee.

3. Parasset price fluctuation risk: The internal mechanism ensures that the value of the parallel asset and the underlying asset is 1:1, but if the liquidation fails, the insurance fund goes bankrupt or the supply and demand in the secondary market cannot be effectively balanced, the price of the parallel asset will fluctuate.

4. The risk of dynamic data display: there is a certain delay risk between reading the data and the actual execution of the data, which will affect the decision of the minter. It is necessary to carefully understand the Ethereum, NEST and parasset mechanisms to ensure that the risk is understood.

5. Redemption requires to use parallel assets, so lack of parallel assets may lead to failure to redeem the collateral.


Users/contracts holding parallel assets need to understand the following risks and ensure that they participate in the parasset procol in the right way (those who do not understand or cannot accept the risks are not recommended to participate):

1. Parallel asset price fluctuation risk: The internal mechanism ensures that the value of the parallel asset and the underlying asset is 1:1, but if the liquidation fails, the insurance fund goes bankrupt or the supply and demand in the secondary market cannot be effectively balanced, the price of the parallel asset will fluctuate.


All participants need to understand that there are the following risks and ensure that they participate in the parasset protocol in the right way (those who do not understand or cannot accept the risks are not recommended to participate)

1. Oracle risks: NEST oracles are decentralized, and there may be risks such as code vulnerabilities, being attacked, and large price deviations, which will bring losses to PARASSET.

2. Code risk: parasset is a decentralized protocol, due to the risk brought by the code, all participants may lose part or all of the funds; code upgrades may also bring the risk of incompatibility between the old and new protocols, resulting in the loss of part of the time value.

3. ETH underlying risk: Vulnerabilities in ETH underlying code may cause the entire contract to become invalid or cause large losses.

4. Due to the calculation of the accuracy of the token, there will be a loss of accuracy in the redemption of insurance funds.

5. Regulatory risk: At present, DEFI has no clear regulatory policy, so any changes in regulatory policy may bring the risk of user losses.

6. Risk of incorrect operation: the user cannot operate the contract correctly, resulting in losses.

7. The user failed to identify the correct contract address and entered the contract that was maliciously copied, causing the risk of loss.

8. The mismatch of user risk preferences makes it impossible to achieve expectations, so it is recommended to fully understand the parasset mechanism and the risk structure of DEFI.
